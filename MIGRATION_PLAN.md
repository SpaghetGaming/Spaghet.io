# Astro Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to upgrade Astro in this project while maintaining all existing functionality, including the Appwrite integration and security practices.

## Current State
- Astro version: 4.5.18
- Project structure is working with secure environment variable handling
- Appwrite integration properly configured with credentials in .env file
- All configuration fixes have been committed to the dev branch

## Migration Steps

### 1. Preparation
- Ensure all local changes are committed to the dev branch
- Create a backup of current working state (already done)
- Verify all tests pass before starting migration

### 2. Update Dependencies
```bash
# Update Astro core package
npm install astro@latest

# Update related packages
npm install @astrojs/mdx@latest
npm install @astrojs/tailwind@latest
npm install @astrojs/solid-js@latest
npm install @astrojs/sitemap@latest
```

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Review `astro.config.mjs` for any deprecated configurations
- Update integrations syntax if needed
- Ensure Tailwind CSS configuration remains compatible

### 4. Environment Variable Handling
- Verify `import.meta.env` usage is still valid
- Confirm Appwrite integration in `src/lib/appwrite.ts` works with new version
- Test that `.env` variables are properly loaded

### 5. Component Testing
- Test Header component with Appwrite images
- Test Footer component with Appwrite images
- Verify all other components still function correctly

### 6. Build and Deployment Verification
- Run `npm run build` to ensure successful compilation
- Test locally with `npm run preview`
- Verify all images load properly from Appwrite storage

## Security Considerations
- All environment variables remain in `.env` file
- No changes to how sensitive credentials are handled
- Migration maintains the same security practices

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise during migration:
1. Revert to previous commit: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
2. Check that all functionality works as before
3. Investigate specific breaking changes in Astro release notes

## Timeline
Estimated time: 2-4 hours for full migration and testing
