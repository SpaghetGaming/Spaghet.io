Implementation of Appwrite as a backend solution for modern web applications. This project demonstrates the integration of Appwrite's comprehensive backend services including authentication, database management, file storage, and cloud functions.

Key features include:
- User authentication and authorization using Appwrite's built-in authentication system
- Database management with support for multiple document collections
- File storage and management capabilities
- Serverless functions for custom business logic
- Real-time database updates and notifications
- RESTful API integration for frontend applications

The project showcases my ability to leverage modern backend-as-a-service platforms to build scalable, secure, and maintainable applications while reducing infrastructure overhead.
