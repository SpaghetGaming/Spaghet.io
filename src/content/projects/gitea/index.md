Deployment and configuration of Gitea as a self-hosted Git service for version control and continuous integration. This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for managing code repositories, tracking issues, and automating development workflows.

Key features include:
- Repository management with Git-based version control
- Issue tracking and project management tools
- Continuous integration and deployment capabilities
- User authentication and access control
- Integration with Docker containers for easy deployment
- Customizable webhooks and automation scripts
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

The project demonstrates my expertise in DevOps practices, infrastructure management, and the implementation of self-hosted solutions that provide greater control and security over development processes.
