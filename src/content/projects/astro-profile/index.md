A modern personal portfolio website showcasing my work, projects, and technical expertise. Built with Astro for optimal performance and SEO, utilizing React components for interactive elements, and styled with Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

Features include:
- Responsive design that works across all device sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions for enhanced user experience
- Clean, modern aesthetic with dark/light mode support
- Integrated blog section for technical articles
- Project showcase with detailed descriptions
- Contact form with email integration

The site demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development practices and technologies, including component-based architecture, responsive design principles, and performance optimization techniques.
